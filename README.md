# Population-Data
In the supplementary materials, you will find a file named USPopulation.txt. The file contains the midyear population of the United States, in thousands, during the years 1950 through 1990. The first line in the file contains the population for 1950, the second line contains the population for 1951, and so on. Create an application that reads the file’s contents into an array or List. The application should display the following data:
• The average annual change in population during the time period 
• The year with the greatest increase in population during the time period
• The year with the least increase in population during the time period
